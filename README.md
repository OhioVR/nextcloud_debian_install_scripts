The tech and me install script wasn't cutting it for me but I found Erik Adler's script:

https://help.nextcloud.com/t/script-100-auto-install-on-debian-9-apache-mpm-event-php-fpm-socket-redis-socket-apcu-letsencrypt-ssl-a-modsecurity/22054

and it works like a champ. I'm building a collection of scripts to help automate the process of installing the best parts of nextcloud in a more automatic way on Debian.

The things I'm interested in are full text search and collabora which aren't implimented yet.
